People can collaborate and explain ideas easily by being able to draw on a shared board. 

It's not just a blank canvas though, if you want to elaborate on an existing picture, pdf, presentation, with a press of a button the screenshot of it will be seen by all other connected users.
It is useful even offline: while giving a talk and showing a presentation, you can draw over other open programs, and switch over to them (e.g. to change slides) while your drawing stays in front.
